This challenge was resolved by Goncy in Youtube, in a few words we must fetch some API and retreive the movies and series and showcase them separately. I took the base of that challenge and twisted it a little bit, adding a few more functions, such as adding a movie/series to your favourites, searching them individually and also showing them in an individual page.
